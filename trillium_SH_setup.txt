# Trilium Notes: Self-Hosted Setup Guide (Docker & Linux)

This guide will walk you through setting up Trilium Notes as a self-hosted, private note-taking solution on a Linux server using Docker.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Server -Debian 12 Bookworm
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed  
  ([Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) | [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/))

---

## 1. Create a Directory for Trilium Data

```bash
mkdir -p ~/trilium-data
```

This folder will store your notes and configuration files.

---

## 2. Create a Docker Compose File

Create a file named `docker-compose.yml` in your home directory or project folder:

```yaml name=docker-compose.yml
version: '3.3'
services:
  trilium:
    image: zadam/trilium:latest
    container_name: trilium
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    volumes:
      - ~/trilium-data:/home/node/trilium-data
    environment:
      - TZ=UTC
```

- Change `8080:8080` if you want to use a different port.
- Change `~/trilium-data` if you prefer a different host path.

---

## 3. Start Trilium with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

- The `-d` flag runs Trilium in detached (background) mode.

---

## 4. Access Trilium Notes

- Open your browser and go to:  
  **http://your-server-ip:8080**
- On first launch, you'll be prompted to set up your admin account.

---

## 5. (Optional) Update Trilium

To update to the latest version:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

---

## 6. (Optional) Enable HTTPS

For production, secure your Trilium instance:

- **Recommended:** Use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Caddy, Traefik) with SSL (Let's Encrypt).
- [Trilium Reverse Proxy Example (docs)](https://github.com/zadam/trilium/wiki/Reverse-proxy-configuration)

---

## 7. (Optional) Set Up Backups

Regularly backup the `~/trilium-data` directory to avoid data loss.

---

## 8. Useful Resources

- [Trilium Notes GitHub](https://github.com/zadam/trilium)
- [Trilium Wiki](https://github.com/zadam/trilium/wiki)
- [Docker Hub Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/zadam/trilium)

**Youâ€™re done!**  
You now have a private, self-hosted Trilium Notes instance running on your Linux server.
