## Practical Tips

- **Always refer to the documentation** for each image/service for supported environment variables and recommendations.
- **Use `env_file` for sensitive values** and to keep your Compose file clean.
- **Leverage networks and volumes** for security, flexibility, and persistence.
- **Resource limits (`ulimits`, `mem_limit`, `cpus`, etc.)** help prevent one container from starving others or crashing the host.
- **Healthchecks** are crucial for orchestrators to restart unhealthy services automatically.
- **Avoid `privileged`** unless absolutely necessary for your use case.
- **Use labels and metadata** for automation, monitoring, and documentation.
- **Profiles** let you customize which services run for dev, test, CI, or prod.
