# How to Optimize Your Codeblock Requests to Copilot

## 1. Be Specific About Your Environment

- **State the language, framework, and version.**
  - _Example:_  
    “Give me a Python 3.10 Flask app with a Prometheus metrics endpoint.”

## 2. Define the Output Format

- **Request output in a specific file or code block.**
  - _Example:_  
    “Generate a `docker-compose.yml` file for Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki.”

## 3. Clarify the Use Case or Goal

- **Explain what you want the code to do.**
  - _Example:_  
    “Show a Node.js Express middleware to count HTTP 500 errors for Prometheus.”

## 4. Include Resource or Constraint Details

- **Mention ports, dependencies, or special requirements.**
  - _Example:_  
    “Expose Grafana on port 4000 instead of 3000.”

## 5. Indicate Minimal vs. Production-Ready

- **Say if you want a minimal example or a production-ready setup.**
  - _Example:_  
    “Give me a minimal working Compose file for OpenWebUI and Prometheus.”

## 6. Ask for Comments or Explanations (Optional)

- **Request inline comments or a post-block explanation.**
  - _Example:_  
    “Add comments to explain each service in the Compose file.”

## 7. Reference Previous Context if Needed

- **If building on a previous codeblock, mention what to add or change.**
  - _Example:_  
    “Extend the previous Compose file to add cAdvisor.”

## 8. Provide Example Data or Structure (for APIs, etc.)

- **If you need an API or config example, specify the endpoint/fields.**
  - _Example:_  
    “Show a Prometheus scrape config for a service at `myapp:8080`.”

## Example: Optimized vs. Vague Query

**Vague:**  
> “Show me a docker compose file.”

**Optimized:**  
> “Generate a Docker Compose file for Prometheus, Grafana (on port 4000), Loki, and cAdvisor, using a custom user-defined network called `monitoring`.”

## Pro Tips

- **Batch requests:** Ask for all related files or configs at once for consistent results.
- **Iterate:** Clarify or refine your prompt based on the output you receive.
- **Request edits:** “Now add persistent volumes to the Compose file.”

**The more details you provide, the better the codeblock Copilot can generate for you!**
